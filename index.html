            <p class="s-three">"Before joining the bootcamp, I've <br> never Written a line of code. I needed <br>some structure from professional <br>who can help me learn progamming <br> step by step.I was encouraged to <br>enroll by a former student of theirs <br>who can only say wonderful things <br>about the program. The entire <br> curriculum and staff did not <br>disappoint. They were very hands-on <br>and I never had to wait long for <br>asistance. The agile team project, in <br>particular, was outstanding. It took <br>my learning to the next level in a way <br>that no tutorial could ever have. In <br>fact, I've often referred to it during <br>interviews as an example of my <br>developent experience. It certainly <br> helped me land a job as a full-stack <br> developer after receiving multiple <br> offers. 100% recommend!"</p>
